# TAP-14 Amendment: TTY Build Last Line

## Problem

Build systems and test runners often display a continuously updated
status line at the bottom of the terminal — a progress bar, a spinner,
or a summary of passed/failed counts. Tools like `npm` and `nix build`
use this pattern extensively: a single trailing line that shows build
progress, rewritten in place using ANSI cursor control sequences and
color output, while completed output scrolls above it.

TAP-14 has no standard way to represent this pattern. Producers that
want a live-updating status line must either:

1. Emit status updates to stderr, losing association with the TAP
   stream.
2. Emit multiple comment lines that scroll the terminal, cluttering
   the output with stale status.
3. Use ad-hoc ANSI sequences inline, confusing harnesses that do not
   expect cursor movement in TAP output.

This amendment provides a standard mechanism for a single trailing
status line that producers update in place.

## Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Specification

### Activation

The pragma is activated with:

```tap
pragma +tty-build-last-line
```

This pragma is document-wide. Once set, it applies for the remainder
of the document. Producers MUST NOT deactivate it with
`pragma -tty-build-last-line` after activating it.

### Behavior

When `tty-build-last-line` is active, the producer MAY maintain a
single trailing line at the end of the TAP output that is continuously
updated using ANSI escape sequences (cursor movement, line clearing,
SGR color codes). This line:

1. MUST always be the last line of the output at any point in time.
2. MUST be prefixed with `# ` (hash, space), making it a valid TAP
   comment.
3. MAY contain ANSI SGR sequences for colored output.
4. MAY be rewritten in place using ANSI cursor control sequences
   (e.g., carriage return `\r`, `ESC [2K` to clear the line).
5. MUST NOT span more than one line.

The content after the `# ` prefix is display-only and MUST be ignored
by harnesses, consistent with TAP-14's treatment of comment lines.

### Producer Requirements

Producers SHOULD emit `pragma +tty-build-last-line` only when standard
output is a terminal (TTY). Producers MUST NOT emit this pragma when
output is redirected to a file or pipe, unless the user has explicitly
requested it (e.g., via a `--color=always` flag).

Producers MAY respect the `NO_COLOR` environment variable. When
`NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty value, producers SHOULD suppress ANSI
sequences in the trailing line but MAY still update it in place.

When the TAP stream is complete, the producer SHOULD emit a final
newline after the last update to the trailing line, ensuring the
terminal prompt appears on a clean line.

### Harness Behavior

Harnesses MUST treat the trailing line as an ordinary comment — its
content after `# ` is ignored like any other comment line.

Harnesses that consume TAP from a pipe or file will never see ANSI
cursor control sequences (since producers MUST NOT emit the pragma in
non-TTY contexts), so no special handling is required.

Harnesses that consume TAP directly from a TTY MAY strip ANSI
sequences from the trailing line before processing. Since the line is
a comment, this is purely cosmetic.

### Example

A TAP stream with a live-updating build status line, shown at two
points in time. ANSI sequences are shown in `\033[...m` and `\r`
notation:

At time T1 (first test passed):

```tap
TAP version 14
pragma +tty-build-last-line
1..3
ok 1 - compile
# \033[36m⠋ running tests... 1/3 passed\033[0m
```

At time T2 (all tests complete, trailing line rewritten):

```tap
TAP version 14
pragma +tty-build-last-line
1..3
ok 1 - compile
ok 2 - unit tests
not ok 3 - integration tests
  ---
  message: "connection refused"
  severity: fail
  ...
# \033[32m✓ 2 passed\033[0m, \033[31m✗ 1 failed\033[0m
```

The trailing `# ...` line is updated in place on the terminal. A
harness sees it as a comment and ignores its content.

### Interaction with Streamed Output

When both `streamed-output` and `tty-build-last-line` are active, the
trailing line is distinct from streamed output comment lines. Streamed
output lines are emitted sequentially and associated with test points;
the trailing line is a single line that is rewritten in place and has
no association with any test point.

Producers SHOULD ensure the trailing line remains below all streamed
output lines.

### Interaction with Subtests

In a subtest, `pragma +tty-build-last-line` applies only to that
subtest's document, consistent with TAP-14's rule that subtest pragmas
do not affect parent document parsing.

A parent document's `tty-build-last-line` pragma does not
automatically apply to child subtests. In practice, only the
outermost document is likely to use this pragma, since only one
trailing line can occupy the terminal's last row.

### Backwards Compatibility

Harnesses that do not recognize the `tty-build-last-line` pragma MUST
ignore it, per TAP-14's pragma rules. The trailing line is a valid TAP
comment and will be treated as such. In non-TTY contexts the pragma is
not emitted, so piped or file-based consumers are unaffected.

## Security Considerations

The trailing line MAY contain ANSI cursor control sequences beyond SGR
(e.g., `\r`, `ESC [2K`). Harnesses that process TTY output directly
SHOULD sanitize or strip CSI sequences to prevent terminal injection
attacks, consistent with the guidance in the ANSI Display Hints
amendment.

Producers MUST NOT use the trailing line to emit escape sequences that
alter terminal state beyond the current line (e.g., scrolling regions,
alternate screen buffers, window title changes).
